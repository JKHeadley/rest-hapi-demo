## Authentication

To test the authentication flow, you must first create a user by providing an `email` and `password` to the `register` endpoint. Once the user is created, login with the same `email` and `password` using the `login` endpoint. If successful, the response will include a `token` field. You can now use this token value as an `authorization` header to access any authenticated endpoints.
